This project aims to create a digital platform that connects farmers directly with consumers, retailers, and bulk buyers, eliminating the need for intermediaries. By facilitating real-time listings, transparent pricing, and efficient logistics, the platform empowers farmers to receive fair compensation for their produce and gain better control over their market access.

The solution includes features such as farmer registration, product listings, order management, payment integration, and customer communication tools. Additionally, it provides market insights and educational resources to help farmers make informed decisions and improve productivity.

Overall, the project promotes sustainable agricultural practices, reduces post-harvest losses, and enhances rural livelihoods by streamlining the farm-to-market process.
